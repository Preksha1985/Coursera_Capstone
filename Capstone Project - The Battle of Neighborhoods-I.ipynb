Foursquare is a location data provider with information about all manner of venues and events within an area of interest. Such information includes venue names, locations, menus and even photos. As such, the foursquare location platform will be used as the sole data source since all the stated required information can be obtained through the API.\n\nAfter finding the list of neighborhoods, we then connect to the Foursquare API to gather information about venues inside each and every neighborhood. For each neighborhood, we have chosen the radius to be 100 meter.\n\nThe data retrieved from Foursquare contained information of venues within a specified distance of the longitude and latitude of the postcodes. The information obtained per venue as follows:\n\n\n1. Neighborhood\n2. Neighborhood Latitude\n3. Neighborhood Longitude\n4. Venue\n5. Name of the venue e.g. the name of a store or restaurant\n6. Venue Latitude\n7. Venue Longitude\n8. Venue Category\n\n<b> Methodology: </b>\n\n1. Getting the co-ordinates of the target city.\n2. Getting the list of neighborhoods and their co-ordinates.\n3. Exploring the most visited venues in the target localities.\n4. Clustering the localities.\n5. Analyzing the clusters formed.\n6. Collecting information about the type of restaurants already present in a locality.\n7. Public Programming Tools like <b>Folium </b> to visualize the neighborhoods in the city.Then based upon the analysis of the Foursquare information we can update the Folium visualization to reflect the number of amenities in a neighborhood\n8. <b>K-Means Clustering Algorithm</b> to group amenities in an area, then we can reduce the number of individual amenities comparisons to be done against each neighborhood. We can do these comparisons against the types of amenities, individually and collectively."
